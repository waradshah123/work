# Student Performance Tracker

## Description
This is a Python program to help teachers track student performance across three subjects (Math, Science, and English). The program lets teachers add students, input their scores, and see whether each student is passing. It also calculates and displays the class average score.

## How It Works
1. **Add Student**: Enter each student’s name and their scores in three subjects.
2. **Calculate Averages**: The program calculates the average score for each student.
3. **Check Passing Status**: Each student’s scores are checked against a passing score of 40.
4. **Display Results**: It shows each student’s average score, their pass/fail status, and the overall class average.
